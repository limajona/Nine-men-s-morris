# Welcome to Nine men's morris

The game starts with the board empty. Take turns putting one piece at a time on the board. Place pieces on any spot where lines meet or intersect. Each time a player forms a line of three playing pieces on the board (a mill) he or she may remove one of the other player's pieces from the board.

# What does the repo contain?

- Several test cases
- NMM.py -> used to create Board class
- proj07.py -> file to be run to play game
